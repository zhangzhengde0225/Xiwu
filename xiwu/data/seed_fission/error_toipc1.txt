To calculate the mass of celestial bodies in a binary system using the modified version of Kepler's Third Law, also known as the binary star mass function, you need to gather several key pieces of observational data. The modified Kepler's Third Law is expressed as:

\[ M_1 + M_2 = \frac{(a \cdot \sin(i))^3}{P^2} \]

where \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are the masses of the two bodies, \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the orbit, \( i \) is the inclination of the orbit with respect to the plane of the sky, and \( P \) is the orbital period. The equation is usually given in solar masses if \( a \) is measured in astronomical units (AU) and \( P \) in years.

Here are the observational data necessary to apply this law:

1. **Orbital Period (P):** This is the time it takes for one body to complete an orbit around the common center of mass with its companion. The period can be determined by observing the regular changes in the position or velocity of the stars over time.

2. **Semi-Major Axis (a):** This is half the longest diameter of the elliptical orbit. For visual binaries, it can be determined by direct observation of the orbit and measurement of the angular separation between the stars. For spectroscopic binaries, it can be inferred from the Doppler shifts observed in their spectra.

3. **Inclination (i):** This is the tilt of the orbit relative to the plane of the sky. If the orbit is edge-on, the inclination is 90 degrees. Inclination is difficult to measure directly unless the system is an eclipsing binary, where the inclination can be inferred from the characteristics of the eclipses.

4. **Mass Function (f(m)):** For spectroscopic binaries, where only one star's spectrum is visible (single-lined spectroscopic binaries), the mass function can be calculated from the observed radial velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P):

\[ f(m) = \frac{(M_2 \cdot \sin(i))^3}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} = \frac{K^3 \cdot P}{2\pi G} \]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant. When both stars' spectra are visible (double-lined spectroscopic binaries), you can measure the radial velocity amplitudes of both stars and use them to directly calculate the ratio of their masses.

5. **Distance to the System:** If you know the distance to the binary system, you can convert angular measurements of the semi-major axis into actual physical distances (usually in astronomical units).

Using these pieces of data, you can solve for the masses of the two bodies, although in{"message": "<class 'requests.exceptions.ChunkedEncodingError'> (\"Connection broken: InvalidChunkLength(got length b'', 0 bytes read)\", InvalidChunkLength(got length b'', 0 bytes read))", "status_code": 42904}
