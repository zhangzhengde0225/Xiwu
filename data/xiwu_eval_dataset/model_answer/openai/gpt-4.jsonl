It should be high enough to generate sufficient gas amplification but not so high as to cause discharges. The exact voltage required can depend on the specific gas mixture used and the geometry of the THGEM.\n\n2. **Charge Spreading**: The design of the THGEM helps to spread the charge over a larger area, reducing the risk of local discharges. This can be achieved by using a THGEM with a larger hole pitch or a larger hole diameter.\n\n3. **Gas Selection**: The choice of gas mixture can also play a role in maintaining stability. Some gases have better quenching properties than others, helping to prevent secondary avalanches that could lead to instability.\n\n4. **Quenching Additives**: Adding a small amount of a quenching gas, such as oxygen or sulfur hexafluoride, can help to absorb excess energy and prevent secondary avalanches.\n\n5. **Cooling**: Cooling the detector can reduce the likelihood of discharges by slowing down the electrons and reducing their energy.\n\n6. **Feedback Suppression**: Feedback from ionized gas molecules can cause instability.

In QCD, the force-carrying particles, the gluons, carry color charge (a type of quantum number in particle physics) and therefore can interact with each other. This leads to a unique feature of QCD called confinement, which prevents the isolation of single quarks.\n\nIn summary, while both QED and QCD are quantum field theories, they describe different fundamental forces (electromagnetic and strong force, respectively), involve different types of particles (charged particles and quarks/gluons, respectively), and exhibit different behaviors (such as the confinement phenomenon in QCD)."]}], "tstamp": 1698325604.5963478}

This discovery paved the way for the development of X-ray diffraction techniques.\n\n2. Birth of X-ray Crystallography: In 1912, Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich, and Paul Knipping conducted an experiment that proved X-rays were diffracted, or scattered, by crystals. This experiment marked the birth of X-ray crystallography, a key method for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal.\n\n3. Bragg's law: In 1913, William Henry Bragg and his son William Lawrence Bragg, formulated Bragg's law, which is fundamental to the theory of X-ray and neutron diffraction. This law is used to calculate the angles for coherent and incoherent scattering from a crystal lattice.\n\n4. Development of Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction: In the 1920s and 1930s, single crystal X-ray diffraction became a vital tool in the field of chemistry for determining the structures of simple molecules.\n\n5.

Computer-Aided Techniques: With the advent of computers in the late 20th century, data collection and analysis for X-ray diffraction became more efficient and accurate. Powerful software packages were developed to help scientists interpret diffraction patterns and determine crystal structures.\n\n7.

Synchrotron radiation provides a much more intense and focused beam of X-rays compared to conventional sources, allowing for the analysis of smaller and more complex samples.\n\n8. Free Electron Lasers: The most recent advancement in X-ray diffraction is the development of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) in the 21st century. These devices produce incredibly short and intense pulses of X-rays, allowing for the study of materials that were previously inaccessible due to their sensitivity to radiation damage.\n\nIn the future, X-ray diffraction techniques are expected to continue to evolve with the advancement of technology, allowing scientists to gain even more detailed insights into the structure of matter."]}], "tstamp": 1698329639.1106498}

String theory suggests that the fundamental constituents of reality are one-dimensional strings rather than point-like particles.

The beam is moved across the sample in a grid pattern, and at each point, the beam interacts with the crystal lattice and is diffracted.\n\n2. **Diffraction:** The Bragg-diffracted beam forms a diffraction pattern on a detector. This pattern is a complex wavefront that contains both amplitude (intensity) and phase information about the object.\n\n3. **Data Collection:** The diffraction patterns are recorded for each position of the scanning beam. It is crucial to know the exact position of the beam for each pattern to enable accurate image reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Reconstruction:** The recorded diffraction patterns are then used to reconstruct an image of the crystalline domain. This is done using an iterative algorithm that alternates between real and reciprocal space, adjusting the object and probe functions until the calculated diffraction patterns match the recorded ones. The phase problem is solved during this process, and both amplitude and phase images can be obtained.\n\n5. **Analysis:** The reconstructed images can then be analyzed to provide information about the crystal structure, strain, defects, and other properties of the crystalline domain.\n\nIt's important to note that ptychographic imaging requires a coherent beam and precise knowledge of the beam position, which can be challenging to achieve in practice. Additionally, the iterative reconstruction process can be computationally intensive. Despite these challenges, ptychography has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating the structure and properties of crystalline materials at the nanoscale."]}], "tstamp": 1698330340.1160831}

Galactic Rotation Curves: The most direct evidence comes from the way galaxies rotate. According to the laws of physics, the stars at the edge of a spiral galaxy should move slower than those at the center, where a galaxy's visible mass is concentrated. However, observations show that stars orbit at more or less the same speed regardless of where they are in the galactic disk. This discrepancy suggests there's a large amount of unseen mass in galaxies, causing the stars to move faster than expected. This unseen mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational Lensing: When light from distant galaxies passes by an intervening mass, its path gets bent - an effect predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, can be dramatically amplified when the intervening mass is a massive galaxy or a cluster of galaxies. In many cases, the amount of lensing observed is too great to be caused by the visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of additional, invisible mass - dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang. Tiny fluctuations in the temperature of the CMB over the sky give us a snapshot of the universe when it was just 380,000 years old. The pattern of these fluctuations fits remarkably well with predictions made by the theory of cosmic inflation, which includes dark matter as a key component.\n\n4. Large Scale Structure of the Universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters throughout the universe isn't random. Instead, galaxies are found along vast filaments and sheets, surrounding large voids. This cosmic web is the result of slight density fluctuations in the early universe growing over time, under the influence of gravity. Simulations show that this structure can only form if dark matter exists.\n\n5. The Bullet Cluster: This is a system of two colliding galaxy clusters. Observations of the Bullet Cluster have provided the best evidence to date for the existence of dark matter. In the collision, the hot gas (which makes up most of the normal matter in the clusters) was slowed down and separated from the galaxies (which make up a tiny fraction of the clusters' mass). But gravitational lensing shows that much of the mass (and hence the gravity) is not with the hot gas but with the galaxies. This suggests that most of the mass is made up of something that does not interact with normal matter, i.e., dark matter.\n\nThese lines of evidence, along with others, have led the scientific community to the consensus that dark matter exists.

This means that protons and neutrons (baryons) can be transformed into other types of particles.\n\n2. C and CP violation: C-symmetry (charge conjugation symmetry) and CP-symmetry (the combined conservation of charge conjugation and parity) must be violated. This means that the laws of physics should not remain the same if a particle is replaced by its antiparticle (C violation) and if left and right are swapped (P violation).\n\n3. Departure from thermal equilibrium: The universe cannot be in a state of perfect thermal equilibrium. In such a state, the rate at which baryons are produced would be exactly equal to the rate at which they are annihilated, resulting in no net baryon number.\n\nThe connection between Sakharov's conditions and higher-dimensional operators comes from the field of quantum field theory. Higher-dimensional operators are terms in the Lagrangian (the mathematical description of a physical system) that involve products of more fields and/or derivatives than the standard terms. They can describe interactions that are not part of the standard model of particle physics.\n\nIn the context of baryogenesis (the physical processes that produced an excess of baryons over antibaryons in the early universe), higher-dimensional operators could provide the necessary B, C, and CP violation.

In simple terms, if CP symmetry existed, the universe would look the same if we swapped particles with their antiparticles (C symmetry) and reflected everything in a mirror (P symmetry). However, this is known to be violated in the quark sector, and more recently, evidence has been found for CP violation in the neutrino sector as well.\n\nThe T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment in Japan, which started in 2010, has provided the most recent evidence for CP violation in the neutrino sector. In 2020, the T2K collaboration published results indicating a violation of CP symmetry in neutrinos at a confidence level of more than 95%. \n\nThe experiment involved firing a beam of muon neutrinos (or their antiparticles, muon antineutrinos) from Tokai on the east coast of Japan and detecting them at the Super-Kamiokande detector in Kamioka, nearly 300 km away. The researchers then measured the rate at which these muon neutrinos transformed into electron neutrinos during their journey.\n\nIf CP symmetry were conserved, the rates of this transformation would be the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos. However, the T2K results showed a difference between the two rates, implying a violation of CP symmetry.\n\nIt's important to note that while this evidence is compelling, it is not yet definitive. Confirming CP violation in the neutrino sector with a higher level of certainty will require further experiments and more data.

Second, cosmic-ray electrons lose energy rapidly as they travel through space, which results in a steeply falling energy spectrum and makes it difficult to measure the spectrum at high energies.\n\nThe LHAASO addresses these challenges through its unique design. The observatory is located at a high altitude (4410 meters above sea level), which allows it to detect cosmic rays before they interact with the Earth's atmosphere and lose energy. This increases the chances of detecting high-energy electrons.\n\nMoreover, LHAASO uses a combination of different detectors to measure the cosmic-ray electron spectrum.
