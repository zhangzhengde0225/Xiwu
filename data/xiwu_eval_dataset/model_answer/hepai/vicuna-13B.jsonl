In this framework, the behavior of hadrons is described in terms of the partons (quarks and gluons) that make them up. Collinear factorization is particularly useful for extrapolating the behavior of hadrons at small values of x, where x is the fraction of the hadron's momentum carried by a parton.\n\nThe advantages of collinear factorization in extrapolating small-x for applications in astroparticle physics include:\n\n1. Simplifying the calculations: Collinear factorization simplifies the calculations required to extrapolate the behavior of hadrons at small values of x. This is because it reduces the number of independent parameters that need to be considered, making the calculations more tractable.\n2. Predicting the behavior of hadrons at small x: Collinear factorization allows the behavior of hadrons at small x to be predicted, which is important for understanding the properties of hadrons and for making predictions about the behavior of hadrons in a wide range of conditions.\n3. Comparison with experimental data: Collinear factorization allows the predictions made using the theory to be compared with experimental data, which can be used to test the validity of the theory and to refine the predictions.\n\nOverall, collinear factorization is a useful theoretical framework for extrapolating the behavior of hadrons at small values of x for applications in astroparticle physics.
